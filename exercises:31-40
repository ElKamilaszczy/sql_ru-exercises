Determine the average ship mw with an accuracy of two decimal places for each country having ships in the database. 

Select country, round(avg(pw3), 2) from
(
  select country, name, bore, power(bore,3)/2 as pw3 from classes c join ships s on 
s.class = c.class
union
  select country, class, bore, power(bore,3)/2 as pw3 from classes c join outcomes on ship = class
)
group by country
